# Userscripts and Stylesheets
A collection of userscripts and stylesheets that I've written. A lot of the css ones are for academic sites that just have really bad UIs, but I'm planning on adding some more that I write over time.

If a website has another thing written for it, it'll get its own folder for the two to be put in. Either that or I'll just make a folder for each thing I write at some point.

If someone could tell me how to link these files to my local repo so I can just modify these files instead of the ones with the extensions I use (like a permanent local server without root or something), that would be much appreciated.
